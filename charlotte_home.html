         <p>Charlotte, NC is a wonderful city to visit, live in, and experience. Dating back to the year 1768, Charlotte has increasingly grown into a prosperous, expanding, economically diverse, and urbanized home to many.
		 The city of Charlotte has been nicknamed the <em>“Queen City”</em> in honor of the German princess, Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. 
		 This city played an important role in the development of America, especially in the Battle of Charlotte in 1780
		 . Charlotte put up a strong battle against the British army, getting its nickname <em>“Hornet’s Nest”</em>.
		 In the nineteenth century, the Queen City flourished by its cotton farming, textile manufacturing, and the role played in the gold rush.
		 These industrial advancements helped build and expand Charlotte to the beautiful, cultural, financial hotspot, and home-city for many today.
